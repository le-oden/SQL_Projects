-- This is an example of a SQL query that is used to create a view to find the top 10 countries by customer count for RockBuster
-- For the dquery I needed to join three tables together and sort the data to create a top 10 list
-- This top 10 countries list will be used in further queries to analyze customer usage in the top 10 countries

CREATE VIEW top_10_countries_view AS
SELECT COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count,

D.country

FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_ID = C.city_ID
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id

GROUP BY country
Order BY Customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10
