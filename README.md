# SQL_Projects
Repository for SQL projects

# Purpose
This repository is used to house files that demonstrate my level of experience writing SQL queries
The sample data set is for a company called rockbuster video. The goal of the SQL projects was to show where Rockbuster's customer base resides and where they should prioritize building out a streaming service.

The final project and visualizations can be seen in a public tableau file located [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/laura.oden/viz/CF_3_10_Rockbuster_rating/Top5Films)
